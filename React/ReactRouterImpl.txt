Routing in React application is like trying to render components based on the routes

eg: localhost:3000/register (Register Component)
    localhost:3000/login (Login Component)

These routes you can test directly by typing them in URL and check weather the routes are working or not.

Configuring router in your React application install react-router-dom dependency

>npm i react-router-dom

1. <BrowserRouter>

	Main tag for Implementing the router, inside this we can configure multiple routs and your components are also going to render between this browserrouter tag

2. <Routes>

	for creating multiple route inside the same

3. <Route>
	having 2 attributes
	path: which path you want to create "/register"
	element: the componnent which you want to open by clicking on this register link

4. For creating Links you have to use
	<Link> tag and use to attribute to trigger the path
