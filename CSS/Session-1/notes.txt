CSS
-----------------
Styling Language

3 types of CSS

Internal CSS
----------------
-which includes CSS only for a page.

-to include use <style> tag in html <head> tag and write your CSS Logics.

External CSS
------------------

Why?

if we want to apply same CSS to multiple HTML pages we should create a a sepearte file for CSS with th extention .css

for e.g. styles.css

inside this file you can directly write your CSS code.

To include this css file in your HTML page use <link> tag

attributes
1. href: link of stylesheet
2. rel: stylesheet (if you will not write this than css will not work)
3. type: text/css (this is not complsary in HTML5)


inline CSS
----------------------
Write a css for a perticular element in a line thats why its called as inline css.

if you write inline CSS then use style attribute of any tag.

<h1 style="background-color: lightgreen;">this is my another Heading</h1>



Note: Inline CSS is having highest priority means it will override internal CSS and it will also override external CSS.

For internal and external CSS prority just understand what css you apply last will override th previously included CSS.
