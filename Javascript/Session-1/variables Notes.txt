//How to give variables name

- name must be a noun, must be some relative name and must be between 0-255 characters.

- name can be the combination of letters(alphabets) and numbers(0-9) alphanumeric

- first letter of a variable name must be a letter it can not be a number

- we can not use some special characters like . , / *, no white spaces.. only 2 characters allowed _(underscore) & $(doller)

- if you give a long name then follow lowerCamelCase

	firstName, lastName, myAdharNumber

	(first word starts with lower case floowed by next word first letter in capital)

how to give values to these variables
---------------------------------------------

values we can call as literals

firstName= "sonam" //sequence of characters

number1= 45.56
number2= 67

condition=true

userName=null
email=undefined


=================================================================================
Variable Declared using var keyword, these variables are having a scope which is function scope.

Means the variables we can use through out that function after that it will destroyed from memory.

We can declare variable also using let and const keywords

these 2 types are having a scope which is called as block scope {}
we can use them inside those braces only and after that it will be destroyed from the memory.


let variable value we can change but const is constant we can not change its value.
